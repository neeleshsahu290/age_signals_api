# age_signals_flutter (Alpha)

A **Flutter plugin** providing a unified API for **age-appropriate experiences** across platforms â€” bridging:

- ğŸŸ¢ **Google Play Age Signals API** (Android)
- ğŸ”µ **Apple Declared Age Range API** (iOS 17+)

Built with a **platform channel + FFI architecture** for high-performance, fully typed native integration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - As of **October 2025**, both Google and Appleâ€™s APIs for Age Signal & Declared Age Range are in limited response mode.
> - Once these APIs stabilize, this package will be updated accordingly.
